R2 IR Sensor (Based off the OrmerodSensorBoard)
==================

The IR Sensor PCBA uses two IR emitter diodes and one phototransistor to sense the nozzle distance from the build plate.  The circuit is based off Dave Crocker's Mini Differential IR board, along with his firmware.

This folder contains the firmware sources for my differential IR boards. The firmware is compiled in Atmel Studio. The .pdp files are for doing static checking or formal verification of the firmware using Escher C++ Verifier.

For the schematics for the R2 variant of Dave's board, check out the R2-Electronics repo.
